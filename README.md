# üìä Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## üöÄ Overview
This repository contains my learning materials and projects related to data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. As part of my 30-day data science learning challenge, I‚Äôm sharing my notes, practice programs, and a small project on Seaborn. This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners understand the fundamentals of plotting and explore Seaborn's powerful capabilities.

## üìÑ What's Included?

### 1. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn (PDF)**
This PDF covers comprehensive notes on using **Matplotlib and Seaborn** for visualizing data, including:
- Plotting from Python scripts, IPython shell, and Jupyter notebooks
- Saving figures to files
- Customizing plot appearance (colors, line styles, axes, etc.)
- Creating scatter plots, line plots, and more
- Seaborn's figure-level and axes-level functions
- Creating jointplot,kde and more

### 2. **Matplotlib Practice Programs (Jupyter Notebooks)**
Two notebooks that contain all the practice code from the notes. They help reinforce key concepts and techniques for creating various types of plots using Matplotlib.

### 3. **Seaborn Project: Marathon Dataset Exploration (Jupyter Notebook)**
A small project that explores and visualizes the Marathon dataset using Seaborn. In this project, I:
- Visualize different aspects of the marathon data
- Use Seaborn's figure-level and axes-level functions
- Demonstrate how to use Seaborn for statistical plots and dataset exploration

## üîç Project Highlights
- Learn how to customize plots with **Matplotlib** for better clarity and presentation.
- Understand the difference between **axes-level** and **figure-level** functions in **Seaborn**.
- Explore marathon dataset using **Seaborn** to gain insights into the dataset.
